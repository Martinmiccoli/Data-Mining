## 🚀 Project Modules Overview

### 1️⃣ **Data Understanding & Preparation**
- 🌟 Explore, clean, and preprocess tabular and time-series datasets.
- ✨ Generate meaningful features or variables.
- 🕵️‍♂️ Discover motifs, anomalies, and prepare data for clustering and classification.

### 2️⃣ **Time Series Analysis**
- 🔍 Find **motifs** and **discords** in time series data.
- 🔗 Apply **clustering** with various algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques.
- 🏆 Solve **classification tasks** using advanced techniques like DTW, Shapelets, and CNN/RNN.

### 3️⃣ **Advanced Data Preprocessing**
- ❗ **Outlier Detection**: Use density-based and angle-based methods, visualize results.
- ⚖️ **Imbalanced Learning**: Address class imbalance with undersampling and oversampling techniques.

### 4️⃣ **Advanced ML & Explainable AI**
- 🤖 Apply Logistic Regression, SVMs, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, and Ensemble Methods.
- 📈 **Regression Analysis**: Implement advanced non-linear regression.
- 💡 **Explainability**: Use tools like SHAP, LIME, or Counterfactual Explainers to make your models transparent.
